For the local setup of this application, there are a few npm modules that are required (react, react-scripts, react-dom, etc.). Once the repository is cloned, typing 'npm install' at the command prompt will install all of the required modules.
Once the user clones and runs the program, the application will open in a browser window.

To run local production mode, type 'npm start', then open a browser tab and go to 'http://localhost:5000'.
